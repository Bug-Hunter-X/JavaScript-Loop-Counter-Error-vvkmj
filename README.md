This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript loops: incorrect loop counter updates. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from a misunderstanding of how loop counters function, particularly when combined with conditional breaks.  The solution demonstrates best practices for loop counter management to prevent infinite loops and other unexpected behavior.
